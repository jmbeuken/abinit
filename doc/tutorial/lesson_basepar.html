<h1>"ABINIT in Parallel" basic tutorial: Parallelism inside ABINIT </h1>

<hr>
<h2>What is this tutorial about ?</h2>

<p>There are many situations where a sequential code is not enough, often
because it would take too much time to get a result. There are also cases where
you just want things to go as fast as your computational resources allow
it. By using more than one processor, you might also have access to
more memory than with only one processor. To this end, it is possible
to use ABINIT in parallel, with dozens, hundreds or even thousands
processors.</p>

<p>This tutorial offers you a little reconnaissance tour inside the complex
world that emerges as soon as you want to use more than one processor.
From now on, we will suppose that you are already familiar with ABINIT
and that you have gone through all four basic tutorials. If this is not
the case, we strongly advise you to do so, in order to truly benefit
from this tutorial.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend you to acquaint yourself with some basic concepts of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing">parallel
computing</a> too. In particular <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law"> Almdalh's law</a>,
that rationalizes the fact that, beyond some number of processors, the
inherently sequential parts will dominate parallel parts, and give a
limitation to the maximal speed-up that can be achieved.</p>

<h2><a name="1"></a>1. Generalities</h2>

<p>With the broad availability of multi-core processors, everybody 
now has a parallel machine at hand. ABINIT will be able to take advantage of
the availability of several cores for most of its capabilities, be it
ground-state calculations, molecular dynamics, linear-response,
many-body perturbation theory, ...</p>

<p>Such tightly integrated multi-core processors (or so-called SMP machines,
meaning Symmetric Multi-Processing) can be interlinked within networks, based
on Ethernet or other types of connections (Quadrics, Myrinet, etc ...).
The number of cores in such composite machines can easily exceed one hundred,
and go up to a fraction of a million these days. Most ABINIT capabilities 
can use efficiently several hundred computing cores.
In some cases, even more than
ten thousand computing cores can be used efficiently.</p>

<p>Before actually starting this tutorial and the associated ones, we
strongly advise you to get familiar with your own parallel environment. It
might be relatively simple for a SMP machine, but more difficult for
very powerful machines. You will need at least to have MPI (see next
section) installed on your machine. Take some time to determine how you
can launch a job in parallel with MPI (typically the qsub command and an
associated shell script), what are the resources available
and the limitations as well, and do not hesitate to discuss with your
system administrator if you feel that something is not clear to
you.</p>

<p>We will suppose in the following that you know how to run a parallel
program and that you are familiar with the peculiarities of your system.
Please remember that, as there is no standard way of setting up a
parallel environment, we are not able to provide you with support beyond
ABINIT itself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="2"></a>2. Characteristics of parallel environments</h2>

<h3>Generalities</h3>
<p>Different software solutions can be used to benefit from parallelism.
Most of ABINIT parallelism is based on MPI, but some additional speed-up
(or a better distribution of data, allowing to run bigger calculations)
is based on OpenMP. As of writing, efforts also focus on Graphical
Processing Units (GPUs), with CUDA and MAGMA. The latter will not be
described in the present tutorial.</p>

<h3>MPI</h3>

<p>MPI stands for Message Passing Interface. The goal of MPI, simply
stated, is to develop a widely used standard for writing message-
passing programs. As such the interface attempts to establish a
practical, portable, efficient, and flexible standard for message
passing.</p>

<p>The main advantages of establishing a message-passing standard are
portability and ease-of-use. In a distributed memory communication
environment in which the higher level routines and/or abstractions are
build upon lower-level message-passing routines, the benefits of
standardization are particularly obvious.  Furthermore, the
definition of a message-passing standard provides vendors with a
clearly defined base set of routines that they can implement
efficiently, or in some cases provide hardware support for, thereby
enhancing scalability [MPI1].</p>

<p>At some point in its history MPI has reach a critical popularity level,
and a bunch of projects have popped-up like daisies in the grass.
Now the tendency is back to gathering and merging. For instance,
Open MPI is a project combining technologies and resources from
several other projects (FT-MPI, LA-MPI, LAM/MPI, and PACX-MPI) in
order to build the best MPI library available. Open MPI is a completely
new MPI2-compliant implementation, offering advantages for system
and software vendors, application developers and computer science
researchers [MPI2].</p>

</p>


<h3>OpenMP</h3>

<p>The OpenMP Application Program Interface (API) supports multi-platform
<b>shared-memory</b> parallel programming in C/C++ and Fortran on all
architectures, including Unix platforms and Windows NT platforms. Jointly
defined by a group of major computer hardware and software vendors, OpenMP
is a portable, scalable model that gives shared-memory parallel
programmers a simple and flexible interface for developing parallel
applications for platforms ranging from the desktop to the supercomputer
[OMP1].</p>

<p>OpenMP is rarely used within ABINIT, and only for specific purposes.
In any case, the first level of parallelism for these parts is based on MPI.
Thus, the use of OpenMP in ABINIT will not be described in this tutorial.

</p>

<h3>Scalapack</h3>

<p>Scalapack is the parallel version of the popular LAPACK library (for
linear algebra).  It can play some role in the parallelism of several
parts of ABINIT, especially the Band-FFT parallelism, and the
parallelism for the Bethe-Salpether equation.  ScaLAPACK being itself
based on MPI, we will not discuss its use in ABINIT in this tutorial.</p>

<h3>Fast/slow communications</h3>

<p>Characterizing the data-transfer efficiency between two computing
cores (or the whole set of cores) is a complex task. At a quite basic
level, one has to recognize that not only the quantity of data that can
be transferred per unit of time is important, but also the time that is
needed to initialize such a transfer (so called "latency").</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, one can categorize computers following the speed of
communications. In the fast communication machines, the latency is very
low and the transfer time, once initialized, is very low too. For the
parallelised part of ABINIT, SMP machines and machines with fast
interconnect (Quadrics, Myrinet ...) will usually not be limited by
their network characteristics, but by the existence of residual
sequential parts. The tutorials that have been developed for ABINIT have
been based on fast communication machines.</p>

<p>If the set of computing cores that you plan to use is not entirely
linked using a fast network, but includes some connections based e.g. on
Ethernet, then, you might not be able to benefit from the speed-up
announced in the tutorials. You have to perform some tests on your
actual machine to gain knowledge of it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="3"></a>3. What parts of ABINIT are parallel?</h2>

<p>Parallelizing a code is a very delicate and complicated task, thus
do not expect that things will systematically go faster just because you
are using a parallel version of ABINIT. Please keep also in mind that in
some situations, parallelization is simply impossible.
At the present time, the parts of ABINIT that have been parallelized,
and for which a tutorial is available, 
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="lesson_paral_gspw.html">ground state with plane waves</a>,</li>
<li><a href="lesson_paral_gswvl.html">ground state with wavelets</a>,</li>
<li><a href="lesson_paral_moldyn.html">molecular dynamics</a>,</li>
<li><a href="lesson_paral_string.html">parallelism on "images"</a>,</li>
<li><a href="lesson_paral_dfpt.html">response functions</a>,</li>
<li><a href="lesson_paral_mbt.html">Many-Body Perturbation Theory</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the tutorial on <a href="lesson_paral_gspw.html">ground state
with plane waves</a> presents a complete overview of this parallelism,
including up to four levels of parallelisation and, as such, is rather
complex. Of course, it is also quite powerful, and allows to use several
hundreds of processors.</p>
<p>Actually, the two levels based on</p>
<ul>
<li>the treatment of k-points in reciprocal space;</li>
<li>the treatment of spins, for spin-polarized collinear situations
    (when <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#nsppol"
    target="kwimg">nsppol</a>=2);</li>
</ul>
<p>are, on the contrary, quite easy to use. An example of such parallelism
will be given in the next section.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="4"></a>4. A simple example of parallelism in ABINIT</h2>

<h3>Running a job</h3>

<p><i>Before starting, you might consider working in a different
subdirectory as for the other lessons. Why not "Work_paral" ?</i></p>

<p>Copy the <em>files</em> file and the input file from the
<em>~abinit/tests/tutorial</em> directory to your work directory.  They
are named <em>tbasepar_1.files</em> and <em>tbasepar_1.in</em>.  You can
start immediately a sequential run, to have a reference CPU time.  On a
2.8GHz PC, it runs in about one minute.</p>

<p>Contrary to the sequential case, it is worth to have a look at the
"files" file, and to modify it for the parallel execution, as one should
avoid unnecessary network communications.  If every node has its own
temporary or scratch directory, you can achieve this by providing a path
to a local disk for the temporary files in <em>abinit.files</em>.
Supposing each processor has access to a local temporary disk space
named <em>/scratch/user</em>, then you might modify the 5th line of the
<em>files</em> file so that it becomes:</p>

<pre>
tbasepar_1.in
tbasepar_1.out
tbasepar_1i
tbasepar_1o
/scratch/user/tbasepar_1
../../Psps_for_tests/HGH/82pb.4.hgh
</pre>

<p>Note that determining ahead of time the precise resources you will need
for your run will save you a lot of time if you are using a batch
queue system.</p>

<h3>Parallelism over the k-points</h3>

<p>The most favorable case for a parallel run is to treat the k-points
concurrently, since the calculations can be done independently for each one of them.</p>

<p>Actually, <em>tbasepar_1.in</em> corresponds to the investigation of a
fcc crystal of lead, which requires a large number of k-points if one
wants to get an accurate description of the ground state. Examine this
file. Note that the cut-off is realistic, as well as the grid of
k-points (giving 60 k points in the irreducible Brillouin zone).
However, the number of SCF steps,
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#nstep" target="kwimg">nstep</a>,
has been set to 3 only. This is to keep the CPU time reasonable for this
tutorial, without affecting the way parallelism on the k points will be
able to increase the speed.  Once done, your output files have likely
been produced. Examine the timing in the output file (the last line
gives the overall CPU and Wall time), and keep note of it.</p>

<p>Now you should run the parallel version of ABINIT. On a multi-core
PC, you might succeed to use two compute cores by issuing the run
command for your MPI implementation, and mention the number of
processors you want to use, as well as the abinit command:</p>
<pre>
mpirun -np 2 ../../src/main/abinit &lt; tbasepar_1.files &gt;&amp; tbasepar_1.log &amp;
</pre>
<p>Depending on your particular machine, "mpirun" might have to be replaced
by "mpiexec", and "-np" by some other option.</p>
<p>On a cluster, with the MPICH implementation of MPI, you have to set
up a file with the addresses of the different CPUs. Let's suppose you
call it <i>cluster</i>. For a PC bi-processor machine, this file could
have only one line, like the following:</p>

<pre>
sleepy.pcpm.ucl.ac.be:2
</pre>

<p>For a cluster of four machines, you might have something like:</p>

<pre>
tux0
tux1
tux2
tux3
</pre>

<p>More possibilities are mentioned in the file
<em>~abinit/doc/users/paral_use</em>.</p>

<p>Then, you have to issue the run command for your MPI implementation,
and mention the number of processors you want to use, as well as the
abinit command and the file containing the CPU addresses.</p>

<p>On a PC bi-processor machine, this gives the following:</p>

<pre>
mpirun -np 2 -machinefile cluster ../../src/main/abinit &lt; tbasepar_1.files &gt;&amp; tbasepar_1.log &amp;
</pre>

<p>Now, examine the corresponding output file. If you have kept the
output from the sequential job, you can make a diff between the two
files. You will notice that the numerical results are quite identical.
You will also see that 60 k-points have been kept in the memory in the sequential case,
while 30 k-points have been kept in the memory (per processor !) in the parallel case.
</p>

<p>The timing can be found at the end of the file. Here is an
example:</p>

<pre>
- Proc.   0 individual time (sec): cpu=         28.3  wall=         28.3

================================================================================

 Calculation completed.
 Delivered    1 WARNINGs and   1 COMMENTs to log file.
+Overall time at end (sec) : cpu=         56.6  wall=         56.6
</pre>

<p>This corresponds effectively to a speed-up of the job by a factor of
two. Let's examine it. The line beginning with <tt>Proc. 0</tt>
corresponds to the CPU and Wall clock timing seen by the processor
number 0 (processor indexing always starts at 0: here the other is
number 1): 28.3 sec of CPU time, and the same
amount of Wall clock time. The line that starts with <tt>+Overall
time</tt> corresponds to the sum of CPU times and Wall clock timing for
all processors.  The summation is quite meaningful for the CPU time, but
not so for the wall clock time: the job was finished after 28.3 sec, and
not 56.6 sec.</p>

<p>Now, you might try to increase the number of processors, and see
whether the CPU time is shared equally amongst the different processors,
so that the Wall clock time seen by each processor decreases. At some
point (depending on your machine, and the sequential part of ABINIT),
you will not be able to decrease further the Wall clock time seen by one
processor. It is not worth to try to use more processors. You should get
a curve similar to this one:</p>

<center>
  <img src="lesson_basepar/lesson_basepar_speedup.png"/>
</center>

<p>The red curve materializes the speed-up achieved, while the green one
is the "y = x" line. The shape of the red curve will vary depending on
your hardware configuration. The definition of the speed-up is the time
taken in a sequential calculation divided by the time for your parallel
calculation (hopefully &gt; 1) .</p>

<p>One last remark: the number of k-points need not be a multiple of
the number of processors. As an example, you might try to run the above
case with 16 processors: most of the processors will treat 4 k points,
but four of them will only treat 3 k points. The maximal speed-up will
only be 15 (=60/4), instead of 16.</p>

<p>Try to avoid leaving an empty processor as this can make abinit fail with
certain compilers. An empty processor happens, for example, if you use 14
processors: you obtain ceiling(60/14) = 5 k points per processor. In
this case 12 processors are filled with 5 k points each (giving 60), and the
last 2 processors are completely empty. Obviously there is no point in not
reducing the number of processors to 12. The extra processors do no useful
work, but have to run anyway, just to confirm to abinit once in a while that
all 14 processors are alive.</p>
 
<h3>Parallelism over the spins</h3>

<p>The parallelization over the spins (up, down) is done along with the
one over the k-points, so it works exactly the same way. The files
<em>~abinit/tests/tutorial/tbasepar_2.in</em> and
<em>~abinit/tests/tutorial/tbasepar_2.files</em> treat a spin-polarized
system (distorted FCC Iron) with only one k-point in the Irreducible
Brillouin Zone.  This is quite unphysical, and has the sole purpose to
show the spin parallelism with as few as two processors: the k-point
parallelism has precedence over the spin parallelism, so that with 2
processors, one needs only one k-point to see the spin parallelism.
<br/>If needed, modify the <em>files</em> file, to provide a local
temporary disk space.  Run this test case, in sequential, then in
parallel.</p>

<p>While the jobs are running, read the input and files file.  Then
look closely at the output and log files.  They are quite similar. With
a diff, you will see the only obvious manifestation of the parallelism
in the following:</p>
 
<pre>
&lt; P newkpt: treating     40 bands with npw=    2698 for ikpt=   1
&lt; P newkpt: treating     40 bands with npw=    2698 for ikpt=   1
---
&gt; P newkpt: treating     40 bands with npw=    2698 for ikpt=   1 by node    0
&gt; P newkpt: treating     40 bands with npw=    2698 for ikpt=   1 by node    1
</pre>

<p>In the second case (parallelism), node 0 is taking care of the up state for
k-point 1, while node 1 is taking care of the down state for k-point 1.
The timing analysis is very similar to the k-point parallelism case.
</p>

<p>If you have more than 2 processors at hand, you might increase the
value of <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#ngkpt"
target="kwimg">ngkpt</a>, so that more than one k-point is available,
and see that the k-point and spin parallelism indeed work
concurrently.</p>

<h3>Number of computing cores to accomplish a task</h3>

<p>Balancing efficiently the load on the processors is not always
straightforward.  When using k-point- and spin-parallelism, the ideal
numbers of processors to use are those that divide the product of <a
href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#nsppol" target="kwimg">nsppol</a>
by <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#nkpt" target="kwimg">nkpt</a>
(e.g. for <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#nsppol"
target="kwimg">nsppol</a>*<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#nkpt"
target="kwimg">nkpt</a>=12, it is quite efficient to use 2, 3, 4, 6 or
12 processors). ABINIT will nevertheless handle correctly other numbers
of processors, albeit slightly less efficiently, as the final time will
be determined by the processor that will have the biggest share of the
work to do.</p>

<h3>Evidencing overhead</h3>

<p>Beyond a certain number of processors, the efficiency of parallelism
saturates, and may even decrease. This is due to the inevitable overhead
resulting from the increasing amount of communication between the
processors. The loss of efficiency is highly dependent on the
implementation and linked to the decreasing charge on each processor
too.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="5"></a>5. Details of the implementation</h2>

<h3>The MPI toolbox in ABINIT</h3>

<p>The ABINIT-specific MPI routines are located in different
subdirectories of <em>~abinit/src</em>: 12_hide_mpi/, 51_manage_mpi/,
56_io_mpi/, 79_seqpar_mpi/. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>low-level communication handlers (xfuncmpi, initmpi_*,xdef_comm);</li>
<li>header I/O helpers (hdr_io, hdr_io_netcdf);</li>
<li>wavefunction I/O helpers (Wff*);</li>
<li>a multiprocess-aware output routine (wrtout);</li>
<li>a clean exit routine (leave_new).</li>
</ul>

<p>They are used by a wide range of routines.</p>

<p>You might want to have a look at the routine headers for more detailed
descriptions.</p>

<h3>How to parallelize a routine: some hints</h3>

<p>Here we will give you some advice on how to parallelize a subroutine
of ABINIT. Do not expect too much, and remember that you remain mostly
on your own for most decisions. Furthermore, we will suppose that you
are familiar with ABINIT internals and source code. Anyway, you can skip
this section without hesitation, as it is primarily intended for advanced
developers.</p>

<p>First, every call to a MPI routine and every purely parallel section
of your subroutine <strong>must</strong> be surrounded by the following
preprocessing directives:</p>

<pre>
#if defined MPI
...
#endif
</pre>

<p>The first block of this type will likely appear in the "local variables"
section, where you will declare all MPI-specific variables. Please note
that some of them will be used in sequential mode as well, and thus will
be declared outside this block (typically <em>am_master</em>, master, me_loc,
etc.).</p>

<p>The MPI communications should be initialized at the very beginning
of your subroutine. To do this, we suggest the following piece of code:</p>

<pre>
!Init mpi_comm
 call xcomm_world(spaceComm)
 am_master=.true.
 master = 0

!Init ntot proc max
 call xproc_max(nproc_loc,ierr)

!Define who i am
 call xme_whoiam(me_loc)

#if defined HAVE_MPI
 if (me_loc/=0) then
  am_master=.FALSE.
 endif

 write(message, '(a,i3,a)' ) ' &lt;ROUTINE NAME&gt; ',nproc_loc,' CPU synchronized'
 call wrtout(std_out,message,'COLL')
 ...
#endif
</pre>

<p>Note that the first calls to x* are outside the preprocessing - they must be called
in all cases, and have their own pre-processed sections. The cleaning and closing of MPI
stuff is done in a central part of abinit at the end of the run.</p>
