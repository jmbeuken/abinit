<h1>ABINIT: the tutorial</h1>
<hr>
<p>The lessons of this tutorial are aimed at teaching the use of ABINIT, in the
UNIX/Linux OS and its variants (Mac OS X, AIX ...). They might be used
for other operating systems, but the commands have to be adapted.</p>

<p>Note that they can be accessed from the ABINIT web site as well as
from your local ~abinit/doc/tutorial/welcome.html file.  The latter
solution is of course preferable, as the response time will not depend
on the network traffic.</p>

<p>At present, more than thirty lessons are available.  Each of them is
at most two hours of student work.  Lessons 1-4 cover the basics, other
lectures are more specialized.
There are dependencies between lessons. The following schema should
help you to understand these dependencies. In blue, one has the basic lessons. The blocks in red
represents additional lessons related to ground-state features of ABINIT. Response-function
features of ABINIT are explained in the lessons in the green blocks. Finally,
the Many-Body Perturbation Theory capabilities are demonstrated in the lessons belonging to the violet blocks.
The right-hand side blocks gather the lessons related to the parallelism inside ABINIT.

<p>Before following the tutorials, you should have read the <a
href="../users/new_user_guide.html"> "new user's guide"</a>, as well as
the pages 1045-1058 of the paper "<cite>Iterative minimization
techniques for ab initio total-energy calculations: molecular dynamics
and conjugate gradients</cite>", by <cite>M.C. Payne, M.P. Teter, D.C.
Allan, T.A. Arias and J.D. Joannopoulos, Rev. Mod. Phys. 64, 1045
(1992)</cite> or, if you have more time, you should browse through the
Chaps. 1 to 13 , and appendices L and M of the book <cite>Electronic
Structure. Basic Theory and Practical Methods. R. M. Martin.  Cambridge
University Press (2004) ISBN 0 521 78285 6.</cite> The latter reference
is a must if you have not yet used another electronic structure code or
a Quantum Chemistry package.</p>

<p>After the tutorial, you might find it useful to learn about the test
cases contained in the subdirectories of ~abinit/tests/, e.g. the
directories fast, v1, v2, ... , that provide many example input files.
You should have a look at the README files of these directories.</p>

<p>Additional information can be found in the ~abinit/doc directory,
including the description of the ABINIT project, guide lines for
developpers, more on the use of the code (tuning) ...</p>

<p><b>There is an additional group of lessons on response functions
(phonons, optics, dielectric constant, electron-phonon interaction,

needed:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="lesson_rf1.html">The lesson Response-Function 1 (RF1)</a>

  lesson.</li>
  <li><b>The additional information given by lesson RF1 opens the door to</b>
  <a href="lesson_optic.html">The lesson on Optic</a>, the utility that
  allows to obtain the frequency dependent linear optical dielectric
  function and the frequency dependent second order nonlinear optical
  susceptibility, in the simple "Sum-Over-State" approximation.</li>
  <li><b>The additional information given by lesson RF1 and RF2 opens

  each other: </b> <a href="lesson_eph.html">The lesson on the

  <li><a href="lesson_nlo.html">The lesson on static non-linear
  properties</a> presents the computation of responses beyond the linear
  order, within Density-Functional Perturbation Theory (beyond the
  simple Sum-Over-State approximation): Raman scattering efficiencies
  (non-resonant case), non-linear electronic susceptibility,
  electro-optic effect.  Comparison with the finite field technique
  (combining the computation of linear response functions with finite
  difference calculations), is also provided.</li>
</ul>
An additional lesson has been developed outside the standard structure of the ABINIT tutorial,
in the experimental Wiki of ABINIT, <a href="https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=howto:temperature">
the lesson on temperature dependence of the electronic structure</a>.

<p><b>There is another additional group of lessons on many-body 
perturbation theory (GW approximation, Bethe-Salpeter equation),
to be done sequentially):
</b></p>
 <li><a href="lesson_gw1.html">The first lesson on GW (GW1)</a> deals with
  the computation of the quasi-particle band gap of Silicon 
  (semiconductor), in the GW approximation (much better than the
  Kohn-Sham LDA band structure), with a plasmon-pole model. </li>
  <li><a href="lesson_gw2.html">The second lesson on GW (GW2)</a> deals with
  the computation of the quasi-particle band structure of Aluminum, in
  the GW approximation (so, much better than the Kohn-Sham LDA band
  structure) without using the plasmon-pole model. </li>
  <li><a href="lesson_bse.html">The lesson on the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE)</a> deals with the
  computation of the macroscopic dielectric function of Silicon within
  the Bethe-Salpeter equation. </li>


<p><b>Concerning parallelism, there is another set of specialized
lessons. For each of these lessons, you are supposed to be familiarized
with the corresponding tutorial for the sequential calculation.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="lesson_basepar.html">An introduction on ABINIT in
  Parallel</a> should be read before going to the next lessons about
  parallelism. One simple example of parallelism in ABINIT will be
  shown.</li>

  calculations, with plane waves</a> presents the combined k-point (K),

  "KGB" parallelism), for the computation of total energy, density, and
  ground state properties </li>

  dynamics calculations</a></li>
  <li><a href="lesson_paral_string.html">Parallelism based on "images",
  e.g. for the determination of transitions paths (string method)</a>,

  calculations.</li>
  <li><a href="lesson_paral_gswvl.html">Parallelism for ground-state
  calculations, with wavelets</a> presents the parallelism of ABINIT,
  when wavelets are used as a basis function instead of planewaves, for
  the computation of total energy, density, and ground state properties</li>
  <li><a href="lesson_paral_dfpt.html">Parallelism of response-function
  calculations</a> - you need to be familiarized with the calculation of

  <li><a href="lesson_paral_mbt.html">Parallelism of Many-Body
  Perturbation calculations (GW)</a> allows to speed up the calculation of
  accurate electronic structures (quasi-particle band structure,
  including many-body effects).</li>
